# .Net Challenge

​
Create an API using dotnet core which simulates a simple bet api. There are several messages included in the paylods/ directory which cover the lifecycle of an event. This is not intended to take more than a few hours, however, you should feel comfortable to deploy the code to production.
​
Your API should handle incoming requests of the type provided in the payloads/ directory, and also expose an endpoint to return all currently active fixtures for a UI to connect to.

## Background

During the course of a sporting event, there are some major parts of the lifecycle. We have reduced this down to:

1. Creating an event, or using betting terminology, a fixture.
2. Updating prices for markets, often due to news about players being unavailable etc.
3. Resulting the markets, or, describing who won the bet.

## At Home​

- Please limit your time to a few hours. If you don't complete it within this time just let us know what is outstanding.
- Commit your code at regular intervals so we can see how you reached your solution
- Once completed push to a public repo and share the link with us

## At office

- The goal of this challenge is not to complete the exercise, but to give us an understanding on how you tackle problems. Please talk us through your thinking process & assumptions as you go.
- Feel free to use any resources you would normally use (Google, StackOverflow etc.)
- Please ask any questions you wish.

## What we're looking for

- Clean and concise code.
- Evidence of testing.
- Handling of errors.
- Capability to abstract code.
